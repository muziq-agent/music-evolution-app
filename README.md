## ðŸš€ Releasing

We use a one-command release script that tags and publishes directly from the terminal.

Example:
\`\`\`bash
./_release.sh v0.3 "Next Demo" "Optional description"
\`\`\`

This will:
1. Create the git tag (e.g., v0.3).
2. Push it to GitHub.
3. Create/update the GitHub Release with notes.


## Developer Safe Start Script
Use this helper to start API + frontend safely (no zombie processes):

- `./scripts/dev_safe.sh restart`  â€” stop old, start fresh
- `./scripts/dev_safe.sh status`   â€” show running state
- `./scripts/dev_safe.sh logs`     â€” tail API & web logs
