# MuzIQ – Vision Document

## 🚀 Mission
To build the world’s first fully autonomous AI-powered platform that maps the cultural, rhythmic, and generative evolution of music — and compensates creators through transparent, decentralized technology.

## 🧠 Core Principles
- Operated entirely by AI agents (no humans in the loop)
- Explores and explains the origin and evolution of music
- Uses machine learning, graph ontologies, and generative AI
- Enables fair IP licensing, compensation, and protection for all contributors
- Transparent and decentralized by default

## 🔧 Technology Stack (High-Level)
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind + React Flow (interactive music evolution UI)
- **Backend / Data**: Graph database (Neo4j or TigerGraph), MusicBrainz, Spotify API
- **AI Core**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Transformers, Audio Embedding Models
- **Agents**: Autonomous modules for curation, generation, education, and IP protection
- **Blockchain**: 
  - Recommended starting point: **Hyperledger Besu** (Ethereum-compatible, supports private and public DLT use cases)
  - Tokenized licensing via smart contracts
  - Immutable logging of ownership and evolution
- **Currency**: Native token called **IQ**
  - Used for licensing, royalties, and incentivizing knowledge contributions
  - Creators (AI or human) are compensated for influence on derived works
- **Wallets**: Digital wallet infrastructure embedded into the platform
  - Enables seamless micro-payments, royalties, IP ownership transfers

## 🤖 The AI Agents of MuzIQ
- `muziq-agent`: The primary knowledge curator and graph manager
- Future agents:
  - `muziq-gen`: Composer/producer of AI-generated music
  - `muziq-lawyer`: Smart contract and licensing enforcer
  - `muziq-wallet`: Handles financial interactions and micropayments
  - `muziq-educator`: Powers user discovery, musicology, and cultural insights

## 💡 Core Features
- Interactive, educational graph showing music's evolution
- AI-generated music rooted in existing cultural DNA
- Real-time royalty tracking and IP validation
- Personalized taste prediction and recommendation
- Full traceability of ownership and usage

## 💼 Business & Ecosystem
- B2C: Discovery platform with freemium access
- B2B: Licensing engine for labels, platforms, and educational institutions
- Tokenomics: IQ as fuel for compensation, incentivization, and governance
- Open API: Allow third-party apps to build on MuzIQ's ontology and engine

## 🌍 Long-Term Vision
MuzIQ becomes the brain of global musical culture — autonomous, fair, intelligent, and transparent.

**The future of music isn’t just streamed. It’s understood. And shared.**
